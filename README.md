Artificial Intelligence Entertainment Network (AIEN)
The World’s First AI-Powered Live Streaming Network

Executive Summary
The Artificial Intelligence Entertainment Network (AIEN) is a fully built, AI-powered live streaming ecosystem uniting Film, Music, Sports, Theatre, and Gaming under one platform. All front-end systems, streaming infrastructure, monetization, and user interfaces are completed and ready for launch.

The only remaining development phase is the AI Studio — the creative engine that connects AIEN to global AI content creation platforms. AI Studio enables creators to generate, edit, and upload content directly from third-party AI tools into the AIEN streaming network.

What’s Completed
- Front-End Development (Figma + Functional UI/UX)
- Global Live Streaming Infrastructure
- Monetization and Reward Systems
- Cross-Vertical Integration for Film, Music, Sports, Theatre, and Gaming
- Remaining Work: AI Studio Integration

Public Front-End Access (Reference Only)
Developers have public access to view the fully completed AIEN front-end designs and workflows across all verticals. This allows contributors to clearly understand the live system and integration points for AI Studio.

AI Studio Integration Goal
The AI Studio is the creation hub that connects creators, athletes, musicians, and gamers to top-tier AI tools. Developers will help integrate AI Studio with the world’s leading AI generation platforms so creators can design, produce, and publish their work directly to AIEN.

Integration Targets
Developers will build or connect APIs and SDKs with the following partners and technologies:
- Film / Video: Runway, LTX Studio, Sora
- Sports Simulation: Veo 3, Pixellot, Replai
- Music Creation: Suno, Udio, Soundful, Mubert
- Voice & Performance: ElevenLabs, HeyGen, Synthesia
- Gaming / World Building: Unity Muse, Inworld AI, Scenario

Developer Objectives
- Build API connectors for third-party AI tools.
- Create AI Studio modules for content generation (video, audio, sports, theatre, and gaming).
- Design interface logic that connects Figma UI to backend data and streaming endpoints.
- Expand the AI Studio SDK so future creators can easily integrate new AI providers.
